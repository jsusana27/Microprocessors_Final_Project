# Smart Plantation - Microprocessor Final Project

This project was the final submission for the course **ECE 36200: Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing**. It was developed using assembly language for the **Motorola 68HC12 microcontroller**.

## Overview
The project is a "Smart Plantation" system designed to optimize agricultural processes using embedded systems. It interacts with various peripherals, including a stepper motor, DC motor, LCD display, hex keypad, and more, utilizing real-time interrupts, request interrupts, and subroutines.

## Project Features
- **Assembly Language**: Implemented the entire system in assembly language for the Motorola 68HC12 microcontroller.
- **Peripheral Control**: Managed devices such as stepper motors, DC motors, LCD display, and hex keypad using real-time interrupts and subroutines.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Used real-time interrupts and request interrupts for efficient system operation and control.

## Files Included
- **Final_Project_Main.txt**: Main assembly code for the project.
- **Final_Project_IRQ.txt**: Interrupt handling code.
- **Final_Project_RTI.txt**: Real-time interrupt code.
- **Final_Project_keypad.txt**: Code handling keypad inputs.
- **2.FA22 Smart Plantation.docx**: Project report and requirements document.
